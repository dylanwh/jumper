Browser url completion for things I visit dozens of time every day is absolutely terrible.
Jumper is a simple manually-curated index or collection of bookmarks that can be used as a replacement for your browser's default search engine. Provided you seed it with the links that are most important to you, it will usually find the right url, unlike the default behavior of literally every modern browser.

Yes I'm a bit bitter about this.

It also exposes a data format that Alfred can use for filtering results.
